(** [is_exported_declaration ~obj_loc meths] returns [true] if [obj_loc] was

    above, marked defined via {!mark_defined} below, and not removed, with
    at most [max_uses] [use_loc] associated via {!add_use} above.

val add_alias : orig_loc:Lexing.position -> alias_loc:Lexing.position -> ?meth_name:string -> t -> t
(** [add_alias ~orig_loc ~alias_loc ?meth_name meths] returns a [t] containing the
    same info as [meths], plus an extra equivalence between [orig_loc] and
    [alias_loc].
    This equivalence implies that a use of either is a use of both. In
    particular, a use of the [alias_loc] is a use of the [orig_loc].

    encountered.

(** [mark_inherited ~builddir ~obj_loc ~meth_name ~inherited_path meths]
    returns a [t] containing the same info as [meths], plus an extra
    inheritance marker : [meth_name] at [obj_loc] in [builddir] is actually
    inherited from [inherited_path].
    This overrides any previous marker for that method.

    that [meth_name] at [obj_loc] in [builddir] is virtual encountered.
    This overrides any previous marker for that method.
